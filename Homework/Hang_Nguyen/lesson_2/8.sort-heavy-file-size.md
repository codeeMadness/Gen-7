<h3>You have a 200 GB file on disk, one string per line.</h3>
<h3>How to sort the file with only 2 GB RAM machine.</h3>
##################################################################

*Answer*
Our main memory = 2 GB RAM

1. Break file into chunks (size = 2GB, which would be 200 GB/ 2GB = 100 chunks) and sort each chunk using QuickSort

2. Write sorted data to disk.

3. Repeat step 1 and 2 until you read the entire file

4. Form every sorted chunk, read the first 10MB (anything value should be less than 2GB/100chunks ~ 20MB) into input buffers.
With 100chunks we will have 1GB in total for input buffers and allocate 2GB (RAM) - 1GB = 1GB free for output buffers.
It might provide better performance to make the output buffer larger and the input buffers slightly smaller.

5. Perform a 100-way merge and store result into 1GB free output buffer. Whenere output buffer is filled, write to final file and empty output.
Whenever any of 100 input buffers is emptied, fill them with next 10MB sorted chunk until no more data in chunk.
