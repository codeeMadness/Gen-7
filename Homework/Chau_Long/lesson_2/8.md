<h3>You have a 200 GB file on disk, one string per line.</h3>
<h3>How to sort the file with only 2 GB RAM machine.</h3>

*Answer*

1. Separate file into 100 chunks each with size 2GB (chunk size = total size / 100 = 200 GB / 100 = 20GB). The reason why we choose the size of each chunk is 20GB because it is equal to the size of current RAM.
2. Take each chunk into the RAM and sort it by any sort (prefer quicksort with large size) with average time complexity is O(NlogN).
3. Update the result after sorting at RAM back to previous chunk location on disk.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to all 100 chunks. It takes O(100 * NlogN)
5. Now we have 100 chunks, first we create a min heap in the RAM.
6. Taking the smallest element from each chunks into the heap. We can take it like this (element, group_element).
7. Then we take element out of heap into the result array. And add a new smallest element from the same element group with the newly taken element.
8. Continue it until all the element in all chunks are taken.
9. Taken all elements from heap steps by steps into result in disk. This step takes O(100 * NlogK).
10. Overall it takes O(NlogN + NlogK) = O(NlogN) while N >> k
